    "2. I use 1 deck of card, shuffled 30 times.\n",
    "3. The dealer plays against only one player.\n",
    "4. Player can perform only two actions - Hit (i.e. receive another card) or Stay (i.e. stop receiving cards).\n",
    "5. Dealer always hits if value of cards equals 16 or less, and stays if value is 17 or more.\n",
    "6. All face cards have value of 10. Ace has value 1 or 11, and we ask player which value of Ace they wish to choose."
